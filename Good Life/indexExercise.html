        <p>Make exercise routine you enjoy and build on it. Find a few you like and alternate them to keep it fresh. Bicycle riding is my favorite! Walking along with some simple exercises are what I do most often. You don't need exercise equipment, but it is entertaining all the dumb things people will try to sell for that purpose. Low impact activities are better for overall health in the long run. Excercise can also be a nice way to spend time with family and friends. Here is a simple list to help you get started!</p>
		<ul>
  <li>Bicycle riding or an excercise bike.</li>
  <li>Walking and talking with your friends or pet.</li>
  <li>Planks</li>
  <li>Squats</li>
  <li>Lunges</li>
  <li>Jump rope</li>
  <li>Stair stepping, I use a cheap plastic stool.</li>
  <li>Dancing</li>
  <li>Yoga</li>
   </ul>
