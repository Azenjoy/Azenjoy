        <p>I asked Open AI "tell me about living a good life"  The answer is "Living a good life is about finding balance and joy in all aspects of your life. It means taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional health. It means having meaningful relationships with family, friends, and community. It means pursuing meaningful work that brings you satisfaction and purpose. It also means taking time to enjoy the simple pleasures in life such as nature, music, art, and hobbies. Living a good life is about being mindful of how you spend your time and energy so that you can make the most out of each day."</p>
