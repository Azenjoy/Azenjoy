        <p>Make an effort to list a few things you are thankful for everyday. A routine of gratitude journaling may sound cheesy but cheese is good. It will make you feel better to think about a few things you are happy about rather than focusing only on complaints.</p>
		<ul>
  <li>Start each entry with a statement of gratitude.</li>
  <li>Write down a few things you are grateful for each day.</li>
  <li>Reflect on how those things make you feel and why you are thankful for them.</li>
  <li>Include descriptions of the people, places, and experiences that bring you joy.</li>
  <li>Take time to reflect on your entries and how they make you feel throughout the day.</li>
  <li>Use your journal to track any positive changes in your life that have come from practicing gratitude regularly.</li>
  <li>Share your gratitude with others by writing thank-you notes or expressing appreciation in person or online.</li>
